Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Weekly Challenge

## Description

The goal of this Weather Dashboard Weekly Challenge is to get bootcamp students familiar with using server-side APIs. They must pull data from the Weather API by using the 'fetch' and 'then' methods in JS and add it to the page after user input. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website allows users to enter a city name and find it's weather conditions. When loading in the page for the first time, the page will have a default city of Philadelphia. After typing in a city name and clicking the submit button, current weather conditions in that city, as well as a 5 day forecast of the next few days will be displayed on the screen. Each time the user enters a city, there will be a search history logged below the submit button. If the user clicks on one of the city names in the history, it will redisplay the weather of the city name selected. If the page is refreshed, the city name entered by the user will persist on the page.
