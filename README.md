## Usage

This website allows users to enter a city name and find it's weather conditions. After typing in a city name and clicking the submit button, current weather conditions in that city, as well as a 5 day forecast of the next few days will be displayed on the screen. Each time the user enters a city, there will be a search history logged below the submit button. If the user clicks on one of the city names in the history, it will redisplay the weather of the city name selected. If the page is refreshed, the city name entered by the user will persist on the page.
